GradPathway

GradPathway is a web application that helps international students discover potential master’s programmes worldwide. Students can upload their undergraduate transcript (or enter GPA/degree details) and receive programme recommendations based on eligibility and preferences such as country or field of study.

This project is built as part of my Backend Engineering Capstone Project, using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF).


🚀 Features

User Accounts: Register, log in, and manage profile (with preferred countries).

Transcript Submission: Upload transcript files or manually enter GPA/degree information.

Programme Search: Browse and search by programme, university, country, or discipline.

Programme Matching Engine: Rule-based engine that recommends programmes based on eligibility.

Programme Details: View description, tuition, duration, mode, and application link.

Favourites: Save and manage favourite programmes.

Admin Panel: Add, update, and delete universities/programmes.

Authentication & Permissions: Token-based authentication for secure API usage.


📡 External API Integration

College Scorecard API (U.S. Department of Education) → provides structured data on American universities and graduate programmes (tuition, location, outcomes).

For non-U.S. universities, the project uses manually seeded sample data.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Django, Django REST Framework

Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
